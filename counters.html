<title>Multiword monotonic time counters</title>

<i>2023-May-11</i>

<h1>Multiword monotonic time counters</h1>

<p>Suppose we have a multiprocessor system on which the widest possible atomic memory access is one word, and we wish to maintain a monotonic counter wider than one word, which all processors can read in a wait-free manner.

<p>If the counter is maintained by hardware, e.g. a memory-mapped register, then a common trick is

<pre>
const int W = (8 * sizeof(unsigned));

extern volatile unsigned counter[2];

long read_counter() {
  unsigned hi, lo, hi2;
  do {
    hi = counter[1];
    lo = counter[0];
    hi2 = counter[1];
  } while (hi != hi2);
  return ((long)hi) << W | lo;
}
</pre>

<p>If the loads cannot be reordered, then <tt>hi2 == hi</tt> means the low word did not wrap between those loads.  (This assumes it is unrealistic for the high word to have traveled through its entire range.)

<p>However, if the counter is in RAM updated by software, this is insufficient.  There's no ordering of the writes which prevents momentarily observing a torn counter.  Classic solutions are
<ul>
  <li>[Lamport 1990] maintain two duplicate counters and update their words in opposite orders
  <li>[MTY 1996] represent the count in Gray code, so each increment requires updating only a single word
</ul>

<p>The problem also arises if the counter is partly maintained in hardware (necessarily the case for a high-resolution time counter) and partly by software.  In this case, we cannot use the above techniques, because typical hardware does not implement them.

<h2>Extending a hardware counter</h2>

<p>Suppose <tt>counter[0]</tt> is a hardware register which generates an interrupt when it overflows, and we wish to extend it into the bits of <tt>counter[1]</tt> by tracking those overflows.  After an interrupt is generated, the hardware counter has already wrapped, but the high word will take a few cycles to update.  Readers need additional information to correctly combine the high and low words.

<p>One possibility is to also read the pending interrupt flag from the hardware.  The ISR can increment <tt>counter[1]</tt> by one, clear the interrupt flag, then increment <tt>counter[1]</tt> again.  Readers know that an overflow has occurred either when the interrupt flag is set, or when <tt>counter[1]</tt> is odd.  This depends on two assumptions:

<ul>
  <li>it's not possible to observe the post-overflow value of <tt>counter[0]</tt> before the interrupt line is asserted
  <li>the interrupt will be serviced before another overflow
</ul>

<pre>
void handle_counter_interrupt() {
  counter[1]++;
  pending_interrupt[COUNTER] = false;
  counter[1]++;
}

unsigned read_counter_hi() {
  unsigned hi = counter[1];
  bool pi = pending_interrupt[COUNTER];
  return (hi >> 1) + (pi || (hi & 1));
}

long read_counter() {
  unsigned hi, lo, hi2;
  do {
    hi = read_counter_hi();
    lo = counter[0];
    hi2 = read_counter_hi();
  } while (hi != hi2);
  return ((long)hi) << W | lo;
}
</pre>

<p>Another approach is to require some other source of wakeups which arrive more frequently than <tt>counter[0]</tt> overflows, and periodically duplicate the MSB of <tt>counter[0]</tt> into the LSB <tt>counter[1]</tt>.  This works even if <tt>counter[0]</tt> itself is incapable of generating interrupts, and readers don't need access to pending interrupt state.

<pre>
void maintain_counter() {
  unsigned hi = counter[1];
  unsigned lo = counter[0];
  // Check that the counter hasn't gone more than 1/4th of the way around since we were last called.
  static unsigned last = 0;  // nonzero once set
  assert(last == 0 || ((lo | 1) - last) >> (W-2) == 0);
  last = lo | 1;
  // XOR LSB of counter[1] with MSB of counter[0].
  unsigned diff = (hi & 1) ^ (lo >> (W-1));
  // If they differ, incrementing counter[1] will make them match.
  counter[1] += diff;
}

long read_counter() {
  unsigned hi = counter[1];
  unsigned lo = counter[0];
  // Imitate maintenance.
  unsigned diff = (hi & 1) ^ (lo >> (W-1));
  hi += diff;
  // Combine words, ignoring MSB of counter[0].
  return ((long)hi) << (W-1) | lo & ~(1 << (W-1));
}
</pre>

<p>Both routines are branch-free, no atomics are required, and any memory ordering is fine.

<h2>Generalizing</h2>

<p>This problem can also be solved with a reader-writer lock in which readers retry until a consistent generation number is seen, while a maintenance routine periodically updates a structure specifying how to translate the hardware counter.  Linux calls this a [seqlock]; FreeBSD has an analogous [timehands] mechanism.  This scheme shares the requirement above of running the maintenance routine significantly more often than the hardware counter overflows.
